# backdrop.py
This started out as just a little toy project to develop an 
application which just displays an empty window with nothing
a radial gradient backdrop, with colours based on some of my
favourite color-schemes for use in PowerPoint presentations.
It's purpose was simply to be used as a backdrop, to be displayed
behind whatever application I needed to take a screenshot of
for some purpose.

# Requirements
 * Python 2 - Version 2.6 (2.7 should work too)
 * PyQt4 - Versions 4.7.x and 4.8.x are known to work
